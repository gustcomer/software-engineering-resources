title: Design Matters

conference: Domain Driven Design Europe - 2017

references:
  - A Pattern Language - Christopher Alexander - Urbanist
  - The Nature of Order - Christopher Alexander - things that have life
  - Billy Vaughn Koen - Nuclear Engineer - Heuristics
  - Discussion of the Method - Billy Vaughn Koen
  - Streamlined Object Modeling - Jill Nicola / Mark Mayfield, et al,
  - Problem Frames - Michael Jackson
  - Delight's Muse - Jenny Quillien
  - Software Design Centers - Jim Coplien
key takeaways:
  - design is a cycle, think of an Ouroboros.
  - Heuristic: anything that provides a plausible aid in the solution of a problem. Koen
  - ways to structure a domain layer: transaction script, domain model pattern, table module (fowler), database scripts/stored procedures
  - Best Fit profiles is an interesting table.
  - examples of heuristics: for complex problems use powerful languages
  - example of decision: where to put validations and constaint checking?
  - Design heuristics is a powerful tool! but don't take them to the extremes.
  - pick the best heuristic from what your personal sota (state of the art) at the time. - koen
  - design patterns are packaged heuristics - with Context (when to use it)
  - the RDD Role Stereotypes can provide good heuristics. Knowing, doing, deciding. Information Holder, Structurer, Service Provider, Coordinator, Controller, Interfacer.
  - Jim Coplien takes things that have life and apply it to software design.
  - Alexanders 15 properties of things which have life: Levels of scale, strong centers, boundaries, alternating repetition, positive space, good shape, local symmetries,
  - deep interlock and ambiguity, contrast, gradients, roughness, echoes, the void, simplicity and inner calm, not-separateness.

  Design It!
  Building Evolutionary Architectures - Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, Patrick Kua
  Agile Architecture - Scott Ambler
  Architectural Katas - Ted Neward, Neal Ford
  Ron Jeffries Blog - https://ronjeffries.com/ - It is much more updated than his twitter account.
key takeaways:
  - you should do a bit of design at the start of the project and at the start of each sprint.
  - evolutionary design is the art of doing a bit of design at each iteration.
  - at the end he's gonna present the C4 model. He do consulting and ask people to draw diagrams.
  - has a specification of a Financial Risk System.
  - discusses why people avoid upfront design.
  - UML is too complicated. Use a whiteboard, the value is in the conversations.
  - Discusses what kind of questions you should ask before coding.
  - You should discuss a bit of technology (solution) in your charts.
  - Architecture: programming languages, technologies, platforms, monolith, microservices, hybrid approach.
  - C4: a Software System is made of Containers, which contains one or more component, with code elements each.
  - C4: Context, Containers, Components, Code.
  - Take a look at software architecture checklist at c4model.com
  - UML não favorece conversations: why are some boxes red? what does that arrow mean? is that a java application?
  - UML vs CASE tools
  - C4 favorece conversation: why mongoDB? what protocol the two java applications communicate? why SQL if we always use oracle?
  - note that expliciting the technologies aids the conversation.
  - use Architecture Decision Records: Title, Context, Decision, Status, Consequences.
  - Base your architecture on requirements, travel light and prove your architecture with concrete experiments. - Scott Ambler
  - use Risk Storming (in Simon Brown book)
  - Design techniques: workshops, interviews, event storming, impact mapping, domain modelling, OOAD, CRC, DDD
  - DDD, architecture reviest, ATAM, architecture dry runs, Risk-storming, concrete experiments, C4 model, ADRs, etc

key takeaways:
  - you always aim to reduce the cognitive load so that your team is more efficient
  - you can reduce cognitive load by introducing layers of abstraction
  - when you introduce abstractions, you should choose a new vocabulary and abandon vocabulary of the old model.
